# coexistence-via-chemical-interactions
Modeling microbial coexistence when interactions are chemical-mediated 

Codes are m-files, written in Matlab

Matlab is required to run the codes

Tested in Matlab R2018b (9.5.0.944444) 64-bit (win64)

The accompanied .mat file is an example of simulation results, which can be used to produce plots similar to the figures in the manuscript


Modeling the process of community assembly when microbial interactions are mediated by chemical compounds that can be added (by release or conversion) or removed (by consumption or degradation) from the environment by species
